#Wooza's Potpourri

This mod collects some of the (non-gameplay-changing) mods from the NS2 universe, available on the Steam Workshop together.

##But why?
Having many mods on a server in NS2 can cause many problems when connecting.
E.g. clients may fail when downloading one of the mods, and the more mods there are, the higher this chance is of course.

The mod is used on all Apheriox servers (Wooza's Playground, Hamster Wheel, etc.) and is also free to be used by all server operators
